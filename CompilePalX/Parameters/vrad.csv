Bounces; -bounce;true;Set the maximum number of light ray bounces;
LDR; -ldr;false;Compile with LDR;
HDR; -hdr;false;Compile with HDR;
Both; -both;false;Compile with HDR and LDR.;Known to have issues with some versions of Source.
Fast; -fast;false;Fast lighting; 
Final; -final;false;Increases the quality of light_environment and indirect lighting by spending more time firing rays.; 
Extra Sky; -extrasky;true;Trace N times as many rays for indirect light and sky ambient.;
Lights File; -lights;true;Load a custom lights file in addition to lights.rad and map-specific lights file.;
Smooth; -smooth;true;Set the threshold for smoothing groups, in degrees.;
Luxel Density; -density;true;Scale down luxels. Maximum value is 1.;Too low a value can cause lighting errors.
Static Prop Lighting; -StaticPropLighting;false;Generate per-vertex prop_static lighting; always enabled for light_spot entities.;
Static Prop Sample Scale; -StaticPropSampleScale;true;To get proper lighting on static props 16 = slow, high quality, 4 = default and 0.25 = fast, low quality;Note that adding -final is the same as having -StaticPropLightingScale 16.
Static Prop Polys; -StaticPropPolys;false;Generate lighting on props at polygon precision.;
Texture Shadows; -TextureShadows;false;Generates lightmap shadows from $translucent surfaces of models. (Not brushes);
Threads; -threads;true;Override the number of CPU threads used.;
Disable Skybox Recursion; -noskyboxrecurse;false;Turn off recursion into 3d skybox (skybox shadows on world).;
Verbose; -verbose;false;Turn on verbose output for debug purposes.;
