Configuration
==========

Compile Pal should automatically find any game configurations - as long as the game's SDK was run last.

Packing
==========
PACK is a prototype feature that allows for the automatic packing of custom content into a map BSP. It does not cover all custom content, so is best suited for when you simply want to share a map with a friend.
