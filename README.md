CompilePal
==========

Compile Pal is a wrapper for the source map compiling tools that provides easy configuration as well as extra features.

It was inspired by VBCT and serves to be an easier to use replacement with improvements such as:

Fast configuration management:

And of course, a silly 'modern' UI:

Configuration
==========

Compile Pal should automatically find any game configurations - as long as the game's SDK was run last.

Packing
==========
PACK is a prototype feature that allows for the automatic packing of custom content into a map BSP. It does not cover all custom content, so is best suited for when you simply want to share a map with a friend.
