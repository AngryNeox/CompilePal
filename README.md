CompilePal
==========

Compile Pal is a wrapper for the source map compiling tools that provides easy configuration as well as overall UI.

It was inspired by VBCT and serves to be an easier to use replacement with improvements such as:

Fast configuration management:

Currently it probably has a lot of bugs I haven't noticed yet. 

Configuration
==========

Configuration should work for all source engine games as long as the SDK for it has been run last.
