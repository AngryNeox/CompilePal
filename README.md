CompilePal
==========

Compile Pal is a wrapper for the source map compiling tools that provides easy configuration as well as overall UI.

It was inspired by VBCT and serves to be an easier to use replacement with improvements such as:

Fast configuration management:

Currently it probably has a lot of bugs I haven't noticed yet. 

Configuration
==========

Configuration currently only supported for CS:GO. Milage with other source games may vary and development is underway for full support.
