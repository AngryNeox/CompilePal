Configuration
==========

Compile Pal should automatically find any game configurations - as long as the game's SDK was run last. Game Configurations are cached between sessions, and you can choose between them at launch.

Packing
==========
PACK is a feature that allows for the automatic packing of custom content into a map BSP. It does not cover all custom content, so is best suited for when you simply want to share a map with a friend.

Error Checking
==========
Compile Pal can detect and provide information relating to errors using the Interlopers error listings.
