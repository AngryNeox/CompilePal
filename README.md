Compile Pal X is the official rewrite of Compile Pal - the amazing wrapper for the source map compiling tools that makes compiling a breeze.

Configuration
==========

Compile Pal should automatically find any game configurations - as long as the game's SDK was run last. Game Configurations are cached between sessions, and you can choose between them at launch.
